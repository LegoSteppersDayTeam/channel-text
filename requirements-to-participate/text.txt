**Raid Nickname requirements:**

__WHILE IN RAID__ please follow this format: <letter of alliance><letter of role>[experience identifier] <character name>.
Letter of alliance (required) shall be: A, B, C, D, E, or F, to match the alliance of which you are currently a member
Letter of role (required) shall only be one of the following: T for Tank, H for Healer, D for DPS
Character name (required) shall be whatever the full name of your character is in-game

Experience identifier (optional) can be: blank (assuming fresh), or one of the following:
0 (or blank) - slime/golem trash prog or completely fresh to DRS
1 - Trinity Seeker prog
2 - Dahu prog
3 - Queen's Guard prog
4 - Phantom prog
5 - TA prog
6 - Minotaur prog
7 - Queen prog
C - cleared

__For example__, if I was Tank in D team with no slime/golem experience, I would be: DT0 Nacl Free.  In any discord channel in which I can type (like <#818478021563908119>), I would type 

> `/nick`

... wait for the menu and select the nickname command, then continue:

> `/nick DT0 Nacl Free`

This allows hosts and team members to do the following:
* quickly identify who is missing from voice comms.
* quickly identify the asker of a question and understand from what perspective they're asking their question. Which character is the person asking the question in voice chat controlling? Between slime and golem sides, of which team are they a member? Tank, Healer, or DPS?
* see if anyone has not actually read and understood this channel
* see if anyone is demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to follow directions

**Prog experience does __not__ affect participation eligibility.**  Assume a DRS run is anyprog unless otherwise stated by the host.

Note there are other ways to update nickname.  One can access the server-specific menu with a right click (long press on mobile) on the server icon to the left and select "Edit Server Profile" and update the "Server Nickname".

* two people must bring 2 fights worth of reflect capability and 1 fight’s worth of dispel
* someone needs to bring Lost Steelsting for Queen’s Guard
* someone needs to bring Lost Spellforge for Queen’s Guard

Notes:
- TALK TO YOUR HEALER BUDDY IN YOUR PARTY.  Don't both of you start in Spellforge; one of you start in Spellforge, the other starts with Steelsting slotted in.
- A single Lost Reflect may be replaced with 4 Light Curtains IF YOU KNOW HOW TO TIME REFLECT DURING REFLECT MECHANICS.  Make sure to bring one Lost Reflect for Stygimoloch Lord
- If you have more than 5 Rays of Succor feel free to leave out the Banner of Solemn Clarity

Notes:
- If you are responsible for Rend for the raid (i.e. “Rend 1” or “Rend 2”), replace Lost Font of Power with Lost Rend Armor in your Pre-pop, and replace the Lost Font of Power with 2x Lost Rend Armor in your Jump Holster.

Notes:
- __Lost Font of Magic will drain your MP.__  Pack a lot of Resistance Ether Kits, or consider using Lost Chainspell from Zadnor if you have access to it instead of Lost Font of Magic.

Notes:
- Have a plan for getting damage boosting Lost Actions after returning from the duel; consider the above Jump Holster to be a suggestion.  Your job is to do as much personal damage as possible, so no more Lost Dervish or Lost Cure IV.

Notes:
- If you’re asked to bring this, it’s because your team only has 1 true healer and the raid host wants to maintain redundancy on critical utility capability.
- A single Lost Reflect may be replaced with 4 Light Curtains IF YOU KNOW HOW TO TIME REFLECT DURING REFLECT MECHANICS.  Make sure to bring one Lost Reflect for Stygimoloch Lord

<<<|image pseudotank.png|>>>
----- ||||| MESSAGE SEPARATOR ||||| -----
Notes:
* Requires Resistance Rank 16 since this uses a Zadnor action (Lost Stoneskin II)
* Replace ??? with a damage action (Lost Font of Power, Lost Font of Magic, Banner of Honored Sacrifice (for Melee), Lost Chainspell, Lost Excellence, etc)
  * You should have another DPS of the same role in your party doing the actual role-specific thing if you are asked to pseudotank.  You will not be the only melee/physranged/caster in addition to pulling this duty.
----- ||||| MESSAGE SEPARATOR ||||| -----
Zadnor mentions:
* Lost Rampage/Lost Burst is available at Rank 16.  This will be requested if the raid host calls for low man slime side strats.  Slime side DPS at Rank 16 or above will need to slot this skill in prior to taking the west jump pad at the cache.
* Lost Stoneskin II is available at Rank 16 and will be carried by one person on a team with only one true tank, to be active and used during the TA and Queen fights.
* Lost Blood Rage is available at Rank 25 from Dalriada.  This will never be required unless the host of your run says otherwise, but with practice and combination with Lost Font of Power an experienced tank can generate a high amount of damage during its use.
* Lost Excellence is available at Rank 25 from Dariada in Zadnor.  This will never be required unless the host of your run says otherwise, but combining it with a Lost Font, Banner of Honored Sacrifice, and appropriate upkeep (Ether Kits for Magic) may allow a DPS team member to generate a high amount of damage during its use.
* Lost Full Cure is available at Rank 25 from Dalriada in Zadnor.  This will never be required unless the host of your run says otherwise.  Communicate with your team if you plan to use this as __there are important situations where using it will severely impact your team's damage output due to buff capping__.
